# Paducah Coffee Site

Developing a new site for Paducah Coffee Company, with e-commerce functionality and a blog. More utility to be added as I think of it.
## TODO:
- use pipes to change the date output of the blog posts
- Add a 'Contact Us' view/page. Use new forms knowledge to implement a contact form allowing users to email me.
- Merge duplicate products in cart, show number instead of duplicates
  - may need to make Cart an array of arrays, with logic to check if an item already exists before pushing. See StackOverflow page on subject.
- Stock photos in Shop & Product views
- Cart functionality
  - currently, checkout button empties 'cart' array
  - would like to move contents to a 'purchased' array and display it in cart view.
- Homepage Content
- remove 'add to cart' button from Product view
   - find a way to contain it in Shop component rather than product-item component?
- add unselectable "sold out" products to Product view, but not Shop view (MAY SCRAP THIS)
- figure out a "checkout" function
- better organization in Shop &/or Products view ~~- try Bootstrap "card" class~~
  - tinker with card configuration. Maybe the card needs to be on the Shop/Product component rather than product-item?
  - this could help with the add to cart button issue
- make the Search bar work. I don't care what it does, just make it do something.
  - this will apparently be covered in the Forms section
- Change Blog view so that blog homepage displays blog titles, dates, maybe a brief description. User can click on blog title and be taken to blog post.
  - Blog view works fine, but struggling to load individual blog posts. URL is updating properly, so I think I just need to watch Max do it again to see what I'm forgetting.

### DONE:
- ~~Fix broken hamburger button on navbar collapse~~
- ~~Finish routing~~
- ~~Dummy content in Blog view~~
- - ~~Fix active link tracking in header
-- maybe ask in class about this one~~
- ~~Make a Cart component~~
- ~~Make a Products component~~
- - ~~add About view (replace Product?)~~
- - ~~put logo image into files~~
  - ~~use logo for icon~~
  - ~~figure out why logo file won't work for icon~~
