# Paducah Coffee Site

Developing a new site for Paducah Coffee Company, with e-commerce functionality and a blog. More utility to be added as I think of it.
## TO DO:
- Connect to a Firebase backend for product/cart storage as well as blog post storage.
  - users should be able to 'favorite' certain products
  - look into having 'admin' authorized accounts
    - admin accounts should be able to post/edit/delete blog posts as well as products (this may be difficult to implement)
- Merge duplicate products in cart, show number instead of duplicates
  - may need to make Cart an array of arrays, with logic to check if an item already exists before pushing. See StackOverflow page on subject.
     - (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54809558/merge-duplicate-objects-in-an-array) or (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30025965/merge-duplicate-objects-in-array-of-objects)
- Stock photos in Shop & Product views
- Cart functionality
  - re-work the "checkout" function
  - currently, checkout button empties 'cart' array
  - would like to move contents to a 'purchased' array and display it in cart view.
- Homepage Content
- add unselectable "sold out" products to Product view, but not Shop view (MAY SCRAP THIS)
- better organization in Shop &/or Products view ~~- try Bootstrap "card" class~~
  - tinker with card configuration. ~~Maybe the card needs to be on the Shop/Product component rather than product-item?~~
  - ~~this could help with the add to cart button issue~~
- make the Search bar work. I don't care what it does, just make it do something.
  - ~~this will apparently be covered in the Forms section~~
  - ~~array.filter, probably?~~
  - probably going to use [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/doc/) API to search through blog posts and products (that need to be put in a database anyway)
- implement lazy loading and preloading for all components other than HomeComponent
  - first must optimize and reorganize the entire app
    - each feature module must have its own routing config to implement lazy loading

- Implement the loading spinner (cart component, blog component. really anywhere that will/does connect to Firebase)


### DONE:
- ~~Fix broken hamburger button on navbar collapse~~
- ~~Finish routing~~
- ~~Dummy content in Blog view~~
- - ~~Fix active link tracking in header
-- maybe ask in class about this one~~
- ~~Make a Cart component~~
- ~~Make a Products component~~
- - ~~add About view (replace Product?)~~
- - ~~put logo image into files~~
  - ~~use logo for icon~~
  - ~~figure out why logo file won't work for icon~~
- - ~~Change Blog view so that blog homepage displays blog titles, dates, maybe a brief description. User can click on blog title and be taken to blog post.~~
  - ~~Blog view works fine, but struggling to load individual blog posts. URL is updating properly, so I think I just need to watch Max do it again to see what I'm forgetting.~~
 - ~~Add a 'Contact Us' view/page. Use new forms knowledge to implement a contact form allowing users to email me.~~
 - ~~remove 'add to cart' button from Product view~~
   - ~~find a way to contain it in Shop component rather than product-item component?~~
 - ~~use pipes to change the date output of the blog posts~~
 - ~~Connect to Firebase authentication~~
 - ~~Create loading spinner~~
  - ~~add loading spinner to auth component~~
- ~~add a footer with social media icons, sitemap, etc (Google all the info that should go in the footer)~~
